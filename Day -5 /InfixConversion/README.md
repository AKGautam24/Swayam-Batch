You are given a string s representing an infix expression. Convert this infix expression to a postfix expression.

Infix expression: The expression of the form a op b. When an operator is in between every pair of operands.
Postfix expression: The expression of the form a b op. When an operator is followed for every pair of operands.
Note: The precedence order is as follows: (^) has the highest precedence and is evaluated from right to left, (* and /) come next with left to right associativity, and (+ and -) have the lowest precedence with left to right associativity.

Examples :

Input: s = "a*(b+c)/d"
Output: abc+*d/
Explanation: The expression is a*(b+c)/d. First, inside the brackets, b+c becomes bc+. Now the expression looks like a*(bc+)/d. Next, multiply a with (bc+), so it becomes abc+* . Finally, divide this result by d, so it becomes abc+*d/.
